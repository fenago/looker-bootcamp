# **Lab 0: Setting Up a Sandbox Looker Environment Using Quick Labs**

---

### **Objective:**
In this lab, you will set up a free sandbox Looker environment using Quick Labs. This environment will allow you to practice and explore Looker functionalities even if you don’t have access to a permanent instance. The sandbox will be available for one hour at a time.

---

### **Prerequisites:**
- No prior access to a permanent Looker instance.
- A Google account or a temporary email for Quick Labs sign-up.

---

### **Steps:**

1. **Access Quick Labs:**
   - Open a web browser and go to the [Quick Labs website](https://www.qwiklabs.com/).
   - Click on the **Sign Up** button in the top right corner of the page.

2. **Create a Quick Labs Account:**
   - You can sign up using your Google account or create a new account using any email address.
   - If you don’t want to use your primary email, consider using a temporary email service (e.g., [Temp Mail](https://temp-mail.org/)).
   - Follow the prompts to complete the account creation process.

3. **Find a Looker Lab:**
   - After logging in, use the search bar and type **Looker**.
   - From the search results, choose a **Looker** sandbox environment.
   - Click on **Start Lab** to launch the environment.

4. **Explore the Sandbox Environment:**
   - Once the lab starts, you'll have access to a temporary Looker instance.
   - Explore the environment, create looks, reports, and dashboards.
   - Keep in mind that you will only have access for one hour. After this time, the environment will reset, and your work will be deleted.

5. **Re-Login After One Hour:**
   - When the hour is up, you will be logged out automatically.
   - To continue, simply refresh the page, log back in, and restart the lab.
   - Unfortunately, all work from the previous session will be erased, so make sure to export or save any important results outside of Looker before the session ends.

6. **Optional: Using Temporary Email:**
   - If you don't want Quick Labs associated with your primary email, use a temporary email to sign up. Services like Temp Mail allow you to generate temporary emails for registration purposes.

### **Note:**
This lab is essential for those who don't have access to a permanent Looker instance. While the hour-long sandbox environment can be frustrating due to time constraints, it offers a practical way to learn Looker. The limitations will also encourage efficiency as you practice building reports and dashboards within the time frame.

---

By completing this lab, you will be able to set up and navigate a Looker environment, build basic reports, and get comfortable with the tools needed for more advanced tasks later in the course.

### **Addendum to Lab 0: Navigating and Maximizing the Sandbox Looker Environment**

---

### **Objective:**
This addendum provides further guidance on using the sandbox Looker environment, handling the one-hour time limit, and ensuring continuous learning without interruptions.

---

### **Steps:**

1. **Accessing the Looker Sandbox Environment:**
   - Once you've signed up and logged into your Quick Labs account, use the search bar to find a Looker-related lab. You can use **Control + F** to quickly locate **Looker** labs.
   - Select any Looker lab (for example, *Applying Advanced LookML Concepts in Looker*), and click **Begin**.

2. **Choosing the Lab:**
   - Before proceeding, check other available Looker courses on Quick Labs to see if any offer longer usage times. If not, proceed with the current one.
   - Click on the course name and then **Enroll** in the quest. This will allow you to take multiple Looker-related labs as needed.

3. **Starting the Lab:**
   - Once enrolled, click **Start Lab**.
   - The system will create your Looker sandbox environment, which you’ll be able to access for 60 minutes. A countdown timer will appear on the screen.

4. **Logging into Looker:**
   - After the environment has been created, click **Open Looker** to launch a new tab with your sandbox instance.
   - Copy the **username** and **password** that Quick Labs provides for the session. Paste these into the Looker login page and click **Log In**.

5. **Working with the Looker Environment:**
   - You now have access to your very own sandbox instance. This environment is private to you and will not be shared with other users.
   - While you work, keep an eye on the countdown timer. When it gets close to the 30-minute mark, Looker will prompt you with a notification asking, "Are you still using Looker?"
     - **Important:** Always click "Yes, I'm still using Looker" to avoid being logged out prematurely.

6. **Handling the One-Hour Limit:**
   - Once the timer reaches zero, you will be automatically logged out and the environment will be reset. All looks, reports, and dashboards you created will be deleted.
   - **Simulating an Environment Reset:**
     - If you want to simulate what happens at the end of the hour, click **End Lab** and refresh the Looker tab.
     - To continue working, restart the lab by clicking **Start Lab** again and logging in with the new credentials provided.
   
7. **Maximizing Sandbox Usage:**
   - Although each session lasts only one hour, you can restart the lab up to 10 times per course.
   - For more practice, you can enroll in multiple Looker labs (such as *Getting Started with Looker* or *Advanced LookML*). This gives you a cumulative 50 hours of Looker sandbox time.
   - If you need more time, you can create a new Quick Labs account using another email (e.g., temporary emails). This essentially grants unlimited access to the Looker sandbox.

8. **Best Practices for Learning with Time Limits:**
   - **Save Your Work:** Since the environment resets every hour, consider exporting your work or taking screenshots for reference.
   - **Plan Ahead:** Before starting a session, have a list of objectives or reports you want to create to maximize the time you have.
   - **Multiple Labs:** Take advantage of multiple Looker-related labs for extended practice time. This also exposes you to a wider range of Looker features and functionalities.

9. **Moving Beyond the Sandbox:**
   - If you or your organization find Looker useful, consider purchasing a subscription from Google for a permanent environment.
   - For now, the sandbox environment is an excellent learning tool, and you’ll be able to perform all the exercises required for the course.

---

### **Conclusion:**
By understanding the nuances of the Looker sandbox environment, including the one-hour time limit and strategies to maximize your usage, you’ll be able to learn effectively even with the constraints. Follow along with the course, and remember to plan your sessions to get the most out of each sandbox period.
