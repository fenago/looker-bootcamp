# **Lab 0: Setting Up a Sandbox Looker Environment Using Quick Labs**

---

### **Objective:**
In this lab, you will set up a free sandbox Looker environment using Quick Labs. This environment will allow you to practice and explore Looker functionalities even if you don’t have access to a permanent instance. The sandbox will be available for one hour at a time.

---

### **Prerequisites:**
- No prior access to a permanent Looker instance.
- A Google account or a temporary email for Quick Labs sign-up.

---

### **Steps:**

1. **Access Quick Labs:**
   - Open a web browser and go to the [Quick Labs website](https://www.qwiklabs.com/).
   - Click on the **Sign Up** button in the top right corner of the page.

2. **Create a Quick Labs Account:**
   - You can sign up using your Google account or create a new account using any email address.
   - If you don’t want to use your primary email, consider using a temporary email service (e.g., [Temp Mail](https://temp-mail.org/)).
   - Follow the prompts to complete the account creation process.

3. **Find a Looker Lab:**
   - After logging in, use the search bar and type **Looker**.
   - From the search results, choose a **Looker** sandbox environment.
   - Click on **Start Lab** to launch the environment.

4. **Explore the Sandbox Environment:**
   - Once the lab starts, you'll have access to a temporary Looker instance.
   - Explore the environment, create looks, reports, and dashboards.
   - Keep in mind that you will only have access for one hour. After this time, the environment will reset, and your work will be deleted.

5. **Re-Login After One Hour:**
   - When the hour is up, you will be logged out automatically.
   - To continue, simply refresh the page, log back in, and restart the lab.
   - Unfortunately, all work from the previous session will be erased, so make sure to export or save any important results outside of Looker before the session ends.

6. **Optional: Using Temporary Email:**
   - If you don't want Quick Labs associated with your primary email, use a temporary email to sign up. Services like Temp Mail allow you to generate temporary emails for registration purposes.

### **Note:**
This lab is essential for those who don't have access to a permanent Looker instance. While the hour-long sandbox environment can be frustrating due to time constraints, it offers a practical way to learn Looker. The limitations will also encourage efficiency as you practice building reports and dashboards within the time frame.

---

By completing this lab, you will be able to set up and navigate a Looker environment, build basic reports, and get comfortable with the tools needed for more advanced tasks later in the course.
