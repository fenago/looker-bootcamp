# **Lab 1_2: Navigating Looker - A Hands-On Tour of the Interface**

---

## **Overview:**
In this lab, we will explore the Looker interface hands-on. As you work through this lab, you’ll be asked to interact with the different components, allowing you to understand how to navigate the platform effectively. Looker is a powerful data platform, and knowing your way around the interface is essential for data exploration and visualization.

---

### **Step 1: Familiarize Yourself with the Home Screen**

1. After logging in, you’ll be on the **Home** page (similar to the screenshot provided). Spend a minute reviewing the key sections on this page:
   - **Your Favorite Dashboards and Looks**: Check to see if any are listed. Since this is your first time, there might not be anything here yet, but this will populate over time.
   - **Recently Viewed**: Similarly, this section will fill up with content as you interact more with Looker.

2. **Task**: Click on **Recently Viewed** in the left menu. If it’s empty, return to **Home** and notice how this area will start filling up as you work through future labs. This helps keep track of your activity in Looker.

### **Step 2: Explore the Navigation Menu**

Now let’s get familiar with the main navigation options.

1. **Explore**: This is where all your data exploration happens. Click on **Explore** from the left-hand menu to see a list of available datasets (you may not see any right now unless it's been set up for you).
   - **Task**: Click on any dataset (if available) and review the data fields and measures on the left. Just take a look, you don’t need to run any queries yet.

2. **Develop**: Developers and LookML modelers use this section to build and maintain data models.
   - **Task**: Click on **Develop** and see if you have access. If you do, check out any projects available. If not, take a mental note for the future once you progress in the course.

3. **Admin**: Reserved for platform administrators, this menu allows users with the right permissions to manage settings.
   - **Task**: If you have admin access, click on **Admin** and check out the configuration options, like managing user permissions or connections to external databases.

4. **Boards**:
   - **Task**: Click on **Boards** in the left-hand menu. If you don’t have any boards set up yet, that’s okay. You’ll create one later in this course as you start organizing your visualizations and dashboards.

### **Step 3: Create a Favorite Dashboard or Look**

Now that you understand the basics, let’s create something you can come back to later.

1. **Task**: Click on **Explore**, and if there’s an **Airports** dataset available (or any other dataset), click it.
   - Pick one **Dimension** (like **City**) and one **Measure** (like **Count**).
   - Click **Run** to see the results.

2. **Task**: Click **Save** and choose to **Save to Dashboard**. Create a new dashboard called **My First Dashboard**.

3. **Task**: Return to the **Home** screen and check the **Your Favorite Dashboards and Looks** section. Your saved dashboard should now appear here! This will help you quickly access your work later.

---

### **Step 4: Organize with Folders**

Folders are used to store and organize your content.

1. **Task**: In the left-hand menu, click on **Folders**.
   - Click **Create New** and name your folder **My Looker Content**.
   - Organizing content is crucial for keeping your work structured, especially when working in teams.

2. **Task**: After you’ve created the folder, return to **Explore**, select any dataset, and save a new query (like the one you created earlier). This time, when you save it to a dashboard, choose to save it inside your new folder.

---

### **Step 5: Add More Content to a Board**

Boards are used to group related content for easy access.

1. **Task**: Click on **Boards** from the left-hand menu.
   - Click **+** to create a new board called **Airport Data**.
   - Select the **Add to Board** option and choose a previously created dashboard or Look (like **My First Dashboard**) and add it to the **Airport Data** board.

2. **Task**: Go back to **Home**, then click on **Boards** and see how the board **Airport Data** now contains your saved content.

---

### **Step 6: Customize Your Dashboard with Visualizations**

Let’s make things a bit more interactive by customizing one of your dashboards.

1. **Task**: Navigate back to **Explore**, choose a dataset, and this time, add multiple **Dimensions** and **Measures**. For example, select **City**, **Facility Type**, and **Count**.
   
2. **Task**: Run the query, then click on the **Visualization** tab and choose a bar chart to display your data.

3. **Task**: Save the chart to your **My First Dashboard** and check how the visualization updates on your dashboard.

---

### **Step 7: Review What You’ve Done**

By now, you should have:

- Created a **Favorite Dashboard**.
- Explored **Folders** and organized content.
- Added content to a **Board**.
- Customized a **Visualization** and saved it to your dashboard.

Take a few minutes to explore further. Try to find more **Dimensions** and **Measures** to work with in the **Explore** section.

---

### **Conclusion**:
Looker is more than just a data visualization tool—it's a powerful platform for building meaningful data-driven insights. By engaging with its interface through this lab, you’ve laid the groundwork for future explorations and analyses. Keep exploring and experimenting with Looker as you move forward in the course!
